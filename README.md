# HackHERS

Marvel Mania is an Android Application made at a 24 hour hackathon. It is a quiz based off the Myers-Briggs personality test,
which assigns you to one of sixteen superheroes and supervillians. Then, you play a customized game as a that character, and your 
oponent is the character's archenemy (based off the marvel comics). 

This application was worked on by a team of four people, and it won Best SuperHero Hack.
